# X32 Scene App
This Console App will create a scene for X32 Consoles running 4.XX level firmware. The reasoning for this project was to be able to quickley configure scribble strips when working with bands that do not have a pre defined input list.

I'm open to any suggestions for improvement and will add more explanation to different parameters in the write portion of the file at a later date.
